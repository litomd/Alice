Animation, stories and games created with Alice www.alice.org

Repository of some clases with the methods I added to them to enrich the behaviors they have.

Some full Alice projects will be stored here if I consider them valuable.

Basically Alice 3, eventually Alice 2.

I have produced some teaching material for Alice 3 in a series of videos available at:
